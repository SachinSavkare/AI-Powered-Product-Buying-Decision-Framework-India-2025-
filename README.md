# 🤖 AI-Powered Product Buying Decision Framework (India – 2025)

Welcome to the complete project repository for **AI-Powered Buying Decisions for Personal Tech Products in India (Q2/Q3 2025)**.

This project demonstrates how **Prompt Engineering + LLMs (ChatGPT & Google Gemini)** can automate the end-to-end product selection process from researching market trends to recommending tailored buying options for professionals, students, and enthusiasts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In today’s tech-driven world, making a confident, value-for-money purchase can be overwhelming due to the abundance of options, marketing hype, and scattered reviews.

So, I turned this challenge into a structured **AI project**.

### 🚀 The Goal:
To build a **prompt-based framework** that helps any consumer:
- Discover trending personal tech products in India
- Compare and evaluate product features, pricing, pros & cons
- Generate a decision matrix
- Produce a tailored buyer’s guide

---

## 🧭 How the Project Works (Storytelling)

The journey began with a simple real-world challenge:  
**"How can I make the smartest buying decision using AI?"**

Each step involved writing a carefully crafted prompt, processing it through an LLM (ChatGPT or Gemini), and capturing the resulting output. The outputs were structured, insightful, and ready for presentation.

## 🧾 Sample Prompts (All 7 Steps)

This project demonstrates how thoughtful **prompt design and chaining** can transform a simple requirement into a fully functional decision system without writing a single line of code.

📎 [Prompt](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/Prompt%20Steps.pdf)

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Base Prompt – Define Playbook Objective & Structure

**Prompt:**

*"I want to buy a Personal Product for myself in India in 2025. You are a prompt master who specializes in writing prompts for LLMs. Write a prompt that I can feed to any LLM model to create a detailed playbook that anyone can use to make a product buying decision. List the objective, deliverable requirements, and structure of the playbook..."*

📎 [Output 1](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/OUTPUT%201.pdf)

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Master Prompt – Generate Full Product Buying Playbook

**Prompt:**

*"You are a prompt engineer. Create a prompt that will help generate a detailed product buying playbook using trending personal tech products in India. The playbook should include: objective, deliverables, product list, trend analysis, feature comparison, expert blogs, pros & cons, and user-based recommendations."*

📎 [Output 2](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/OUTPUT%202.pdf)

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Prompt – Create 2–3 Page Product Comparison Document

**Prompt:**

*"Now create a new prompt that uses the output of the playbook to generate a 2–3 page product comparison for 3 shortlisted products. Ensure it compares on performance, pricing, usability, and list pros & cons in clear sections."*

📎 [Output 3](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/OUTPUT%203.pdf)

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Prompt with Attachments – Refine Comparison Output

**Prompt:**

*"Use the Master Prompt from Step 2 along with the attachment of Output 3 to regenerate the comparison document with refined formatting, better clarity, and improved reasoning for product differentiation."*

📎 [Output 4](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/OUTPUT%204.pdf)

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Prompt – Generate Product Decision Matrix

**Prompt:**

*"Write a prompt that takes the top 3 products and compares them using a decision matrix. The criteria should include: Price, Performance, Usability, and Value for Money. Each product should be scored, and a final recommendation provided."*

📎 [Product Decision Matrix (Excel)](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/Product%20Decision%20Matrix.xlsx)

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Prompt – Buyer’s Guide Without Attachments

**Prompt:**

*"Now, write a prompt that will generate a buyer's guide for 3 user segments: Professionals, Students, and Enthusiasts — using only the Playbook (Output 2) and Comparison (Output 4), without attachments. The guide should recommend one product for each user type with reasoning."*

📎 [Output 6](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/OUTPUT%206.pdf)

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Master Prompt + All Outputs – Final Buyer’s Guide

**Prompt:**

*"Use the master prompt again, but this time include all attachments (Playbook, Comparison Document, Decision Matrix). Generate a final structured buyer’s guide for Indian customers with sections: Product Summary, Comparison Table, Recommendation by User Type, and Final Verdict."*

📎 [Output 7](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Powered-Product-Buying-Decision-Framework-India-2025-/blob/main/OUTPUT%207%20(Buyers%20Guide).pdf)
